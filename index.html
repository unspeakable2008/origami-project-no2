     <li>2.fold the left side to the right side</li>
     <li>3.make a triangle by folding the top 1 edge to the folded corner. Flip it and do the same thing</li>
     <li>4.open the half and folds the top point to the extreme bottom middle</li>
     <li>5.open up the previous fold but leave a tiny strip in the middle(this may be tricky)</li>
     <li>6.fold the top triangle to the middle and don't crease it all the way,crease it till the cross line. repeat it on both sides</li>
     <li>7.repeat the 5th step without opening it. repeat it on both sides</li>
     <li>8.the crease in step 7, put your finger creating a pocket fold all the way till the end of the paper then fold it flat. repeat it on the other side</li>
     <li>9.pick the fold and pull out the innermost fold. put it on the sides and fold the edge crease inwards. repeat for both sides</li>
     <li>10.fold the tiny area under the part folded in the previous step to the edge of the previous step. open the crease and fold it in the reverse direction.</li>
     <li>11.then you have to fold the whole model together and the folded  parts shouls be in the middle.the fold in the previous step has to overlap each other to lock the whole plane together</li>
     <li>12.cut the back of the plane about 1 inch away from the end in a diagonal manner and cut the other diagonal in the other direction</li>
     <li>13.now fold the wings so that the wings pass the bottom of the plane.repeat on both sides</li>
     <li>14.folf the back part behind the cut downwards to create fins.</li>
